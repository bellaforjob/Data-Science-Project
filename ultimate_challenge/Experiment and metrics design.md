#### The neighboring cities of Gotham and Metropolis have complementary circadian rhythms: on weekdays, Ultimate Gotham is most active at night, and Ultimate Metropolis is most active during the day. On weekends, there is reasonable activity in both cities. However, a toll bridge, with a two way toll, between the two cities causes driver partners to tend to be exclusive to each city. The Ultimate managers of city operations for the two cities have proposed an experiment to encourage driver partners to be available in both cities, by reimbursing all toll costs.
#### 1. What would you choose as the key measure of success of this experiment in encouraging driver partners to serve both cities, and why would you choose this metric?

I will use count of loging city as the key measure of success of this experiment. If the number of logins in the two cities is relatively close means drivers run both cities in the same activity.

#### 2. Describe a practical experiment you would design to compare the effectiveness of the proposed change in relation to the key measure of success. Please provide details on:
#### a. how you will implement the experiment


I will group by city's name with login time, count the login time in the same city, and then comparing:
1. Comparing the login numbers of each city, see if numbers are close.
2. Comparing the login time in each city, see if activities of both cities based on time are the similar.
3. Merge the date in one week, comparing login number of two cities in the weekday and weekend.

#### b. what statistical test(s) you will conduct to verify the significance of the observation


I will do hypothesis testing. H0: the proposed change is effective.(After change, two city's acitivities are similar.) 

#### c. how you would interpret the results and provide recommendations to the city operations team along with any caveats.

If the numbers of login in both cities are similar, it means the proposed change is effective. Otherwise, it' ineffective. 
Reimbursing all toll costs may cause texi driver ignore empty operation and operate between two cities. Reimbursing all toll costs based on recipt may solve this problem, driver from one city will try to get a passager before back from another.
